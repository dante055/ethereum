- now we can define structs and enums outside smart contract

- u can have a file where u have all the sructs and u can import that file and use it

- now we can return a struct from function


pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

function returnStruct() external returns(Payment memory) {
        //cant return the Balance struct cause it contain mapping and ony libraries cant return it
    }

- return array

	/*
    function getPlayers() external view returns(address[] memory) {
        //remember that while calling the whole array the execution cost will increase
        return players;
    }
    */

- casting address to payable

	address a;
	address payable b = payable(a);


- try catch : if an error happen in a smart contract that u are calling
